# objectives

## Always-on objectives
- Enforce guardrails (no total account PnL) across UI, logs, and outputs.
- Run contract checks and metadata validation by default.
- Keep validation fast enough to avoid blocking iteration.
- Keep demos runnable from a clean checkout with accurate runbooks.
- Capture proved/broke insights during delivery.
