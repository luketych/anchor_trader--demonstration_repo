# Actionables State

## Current Focus
- Phase 1 mode: decision and policy alignment.
- Current milestone: decisions and policy baseline (target state).

## Current State
- PRDs and checklists live under `descriptions`.
- Actionable plan tracked under `actionables/phases` (modes of work) and
  `actionables/milestones` (target states and task seeds).

## MVP Demo Scope
- Demo walkthrough for trade plan, review, alerts/events, exit, and insights.
- Mock adapters with fixture data for quotes and broker flows.
- Guardrails: no total account PnL and human-in-loop actions only.

## Next Steps
1) Document demo packaging model and base tag criteria.
2) Scaffold demo templates and runbook.
3) Build the first MVP demo using mock data.

- All actions require explicit human approval.
- Demos must record base tags, deviations, and proved/broke logs.
