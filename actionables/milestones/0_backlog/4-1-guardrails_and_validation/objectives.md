# objectives

## Target state objectives
- Guardrails block total account PnL in UI, logs, and APIs.
- Contract checks detect core interface drift.
- Demo metadata validation enforces base tag and deviations.
- Prompts and responses are logged with approval gating.

## Questions answered / uncertainty reduced
- Can constraints be enforced automatically?
- Can drift and missing metadata be detected before demos run?
- Are approvals and prompts auditable?
