# objectives

## Target state objectives
- Demo skeleton structure exists and is usable.
- Templates (README, metadata, proved/broke, runbook) are standardized and stored.
- Metadata schema validates against an example file.
- A new demo can be scaffolded without guesswork.

## Questions answered / uncertainty reduced
- What is the minimum demo folder structure?
- What documentation and metadata are required for every demo?
- Can a new demo be started quickly using the templates?
