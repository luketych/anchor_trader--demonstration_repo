# objectives

## Target state objectives
- Packaging model and artifact location are decided and recorded.
- Base tag stability criteria and selection steps are defined and usable.
- Demo documentation and guardrail requirements are encoded in templates/metadata.

## Questions answered / uncertainty reduced
- Which packaging model is the default for demos?
- Where do demo artifacts live in the repo?
- What qualifies as a stable base tag?
- Which guardrails are mandatory and how are deviations recorded?
