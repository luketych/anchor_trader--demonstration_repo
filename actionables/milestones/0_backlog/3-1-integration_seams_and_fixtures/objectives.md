# objectives

## Target state objectives
- Adapter interfaces are defined and documented.
- Mock adapters load deterministic fixtures for demo flows.
- Failure scenarios (rate-limit, data-gap) are reproducible.
- Seed data aligns with the MVP demo flow.

## Questions answered / uncertainty reduced
- Can the demo run without live providers?
- Are adapter seams stable enough to swap in real providers later?
- Are failure scenarios reproducible on demand?
